Test Plan for Project Whiteboard


The purpose of this test plan is to demonstrate the ability of Project Whiteboard to meet customer requirements and perform to use case specifications. The SUT consists of the Beta release build of Project Whiteboard. Due to the assumed lack of programming education assumed in the target end user, we will use a black box approach to testing. Specifically, it will be a a specification or model based approach, in which the test cases are derived from the project use cases. The testing will be completed by members of Team Whiteboard. Of the 16 items to be tested, a successful system test will be defined as 15 of 16 items passing test criteria. The system will be tested in multiple rounds in order to gain a large sample of test items from which we will be able to make an informed conclusion about system performance.
